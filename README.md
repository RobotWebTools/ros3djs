#### 3D Visualization Library for use with the ROS JavaScript Libraries

For full documentation, see [the ROS wiki](http://ros.org/wiki/ros3djs) or check out some [working demos](https://robotwebtools.github.io/demos.html).

[JSDoc](https://robotwebtools.github.io/ros3djs) can be found on the Robot Web Tools website.

This project is released as part of the [Robot Web Tools](https://robotwebtools.github.io/) effort.

### Usage

Pre-built files can be found in either [ros3d.js](build/ros3d.js) or [ros3d.min.js](build/ros3d.min.js).

### Build

[Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) is used for building, including concatenating, minimizing, documenting, linting, and testing.

### Install Grunt and its Dependencies

#### Ubuntu 18.04/20.04

 1. Install Node.js and its package manager, NPM
   * `sudo apt-get install nodejs nodejs-legacy npm` or any other way you like
 2. Install Grunt
   * `sudo npm install -g grunt-cli`
   * (optional) `sudo rm -rf ~/.npm ~/tmp`
 3. Install the Grunt tasks specific to this project
   * `cd /path/to/ros3djs/`
   * `npm install .`

### Build with Grunt

Before proceeding, please confirm you have installed the dependencies above.

To run the build tasks:

 1. `cd /path/to/ros3djs/`
 2. `grunt build`

`grunt build` will concatenate and minimize the files under src and replace ros3d.js and ros3d.min.js in the build directory. It will also run the linter and test cases. This is what [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/RobotWebTools/ros3djs/actions/workflows/main.yml) runs when a Pull Request is submitted.

`grunt dev` will watch for any changes to any of the src/ files and automatically concatenate and minimize the files. This is ideal for those developing as you should only have to run `grunt dev` once.

`grunt doc` will rebuild all JSDoc for the project.

### Testing

Utilizes [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [chai](http://chaijs.com/) for in browser testing.

To run tests simply open `tests/index.html` in a web browser

### Examples

There are a variety of [examples](examples) of the different things that can be done with ros3djs.

There are also some examples of how ros3djs can be used in different environments:

- [Classic html script tag inclusion](examples)
- [Modular html script tag inclusion](examples/html-import)
